# Welcome to [DeepNetwork](https://github.com/sousav/DeepNetwork/)!
## A simple c++ DeepNeuralNetwork library

This project contains a basic Neural Network source code.
Which allow you to train, save and load a previously trained neural network.
It also contains a basic dataset generator for AND, OR and XOR gate.
